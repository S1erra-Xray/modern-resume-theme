    layout: text
    content: # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      I love linux and use it on a regular basis. Of the non-human languages, I like Python and C#.
      <br>
      Also like reading technical literature in terms of books and other articles more than watching videos on youtube.
      <br>
      I like to peel back layers of abstraction and learn things at a deep level.
